A **work-in-progress** chart library for [Flutter](https://flutter.io). Until version `1.0.0` the API is subject to change
drastically. Needless to say, fcharts is _not_ production ready.

The goal of this project is to allow for creating beautiful, responsive charts using a simple 
and intuitive API.

Inspired by 
[Mikkel Ravn's tutorial](https://medium.com/flutter-io/zero-to-one-with-flutter-43b13fd7b354) 
on Flutter widgets and animations. If you have used [Recharts](https://recharts.org) (ReactJS 
library) you will find the high level API to be somewhat familiar.
